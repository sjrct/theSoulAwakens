When a player (or any creature, really) needs to do something that requires some
measure of training or practice, such as sword fighting, horseback riding, or
combat juggling, one makes an appropriate *skill check* in that skill. In a non
combat situation, to make a skill check one roles a d20 and adds to that the
their level in that skill. If the value exceeds the difficulty value of the
action, which is determined by the skill and the action, then the player is
successful at accomplishing that action.

Every player has a *skill level* and a *skill expirence* value. The skill level
is directly dependent upon the skill. At 0 expirence, one has a 0 skill level.
The expirence threshold is the expirence to achieve before one gains another level
in that skill, and it is equivalent to `5(level + 2)(level + 1)`, which is equivalent
to the summation of all the numbers from 1 to the next level times 10. Below is
a table containing the threshold for the first few levels

Level | Threshold to achieve next level
---------------------------------------
0     | 10
1     | 30
2     | 60
3     | 100
4     | 150
5     | 210
6     | 280
7     | 360
8     | 450
9     | 550
10    | 660

(Note: I think the difference between these may increase too quickly).
